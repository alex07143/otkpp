#summary Introduction to the Qt GUI.

= Introduction =

OTK++ implements Qt4-based graphical user interface for demonstration purposes. All algorithms implemented in OTK++ are available via the GUI. However, it can only handle functions of two variables.

= Quick reference =

== Problem setup and constraints `[1]` ==

The user can either specify a symbolic expression or a predefined test function. A symbolic function expression may contain basic arithmetic operations and elementary functions supported by libmatheval. The list of predefined test functions contains test problems given by More, Garbow and Hillstr√∂m(1981). The expressions of these function consist of sums of squared terms, and the number of summation terms is given with the m-parameter. When you have finished choosing the objective function, click *Update* to apply the changes.

Rectangular constraints for the problem can be specified by clicking the *Pick* button and dragging on the plotting area `[6]`. They can also be entered manually to the text fields. Press *Update* to apply the entered values. *Deactivate* clears previously specified constraints.

== Solver setup and starting point `[2]` ==

The starting point can be picked from the plotting area after activating the picking tool by pressing *Pick*. Select the algorithm to use from the combo box. 

*Note*: Specifying the stopping criterion does not work with the current version.

== Results summary `[3]` ==

A summary of the results of the iteration is shown here. If several iteration plots are drawn, you can pick them from the plotting area `[6]` after pressing *Pick*. *Deselect* clears any selections, and *Remove selected* removes the selected iteration plot from the plotting area.

== Picking iterates and search lines `[4]` ==

Iterates and search lines can be picked from the iteration plot. Pressing the *Pick* button activates the picking tool. Only one iterate or search line can be picked at a time. The *Deselect* buttons clear any selected iterates or search lines. The coordinates of the selected iterate and the corresponding function value and gradient norm are shown. For a selected search line, the objective function value along the search direction is also plotted as a function of step length. 

== Plotting utilities `[5]` ==

Plotting ranges can be entered manually in the text boxes and clicking the *Update* button. The plotting ranges can also be adjusted with zooming and panning tools: try the *zoom out*, *zoom in* and *pan* buttons. *Clear* removes any iterates or selections from the plot. Plots can also be saved in pdf format by clicking the *Save...* button.

== Plotting area `[6]` ==

If *contour* is selected from the plot type button, this widget draws the contour plot of the objective function and iteration paths drawn on top of them. If the plotting type is *surface*, this widget shows a 3d surface of the objective function. 

*Note:* The 3d plotting widget requires OpenGL support.
