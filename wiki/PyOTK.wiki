#summary Introduction to PyOTK and examples.

= Accessing OTK++ interfaces from Python =

The key idea of the PyOTK(OTK++ Python interface) is to implement seamless interface for the OTK++ classes. That is, the syntax for calling the OTK++ classes and methods from the Python side has as identical syntax with the corresponding C++ code as possible. This can be very conveniently done with Boost.Python. 

The facilities for using the OTK++ classes and methods from Python are implemented in the 'native' module: 

{{{
>>> from pyotk.native import *
}}}

The 'testproblems' module contains the test problem set given by More, Garbow and Hillstrom: 

{{{
>>> from pyotk.testproblems import *
}}}

The Python methods for instantiating OTK++ object have a similar syntax with their C++ counterparts. For example, a GSL 'vector_bfgs2' solver and an instance of an two-dimensional Rosenbrock test function from the 'testproblems' module can be instantiated as follows:

{{{
>>> s = GSLfdfsolver('vector_bfgs2')
>>> f = ExtendedRosenbrock(n=2)
}}}

The starting point is specified as a tuple, and the stopping criterion can be instantiated with constructors similar to those in the C++ library: 

{{{
>>> x0 = (-1.2, 1)
>>> sc = GradNormTest(eps=1e-8)
}}}

minimize is the driver routine for calling OTK++ algorithms from PyOTK:

{{{
>>> results = minimize(s, DefaultSolverSetup(), f.otk_instance,
                       sc, x0, NoConstraints(), 0, False)
}}}

= Visualization =

PyOTK uses Matplotlib for plotting. The following visualizations for the results of minimization algorithms are currently implemented:

  * drawing iterates of an algorithm on contours of test function
  * drawing convergence plots of algorithms
  * computing the Dolan and More performance profiles

== 'pyotk.plot2d' module ==

The 'plot2d' module implements methods 
for visualizing the iteration of a solver. 
For a given function of two variables, 
the iterates produced by a solver can be plotted 
on top of contours of the objective function.

== 'pyotk.convergence' module ==

A convergence plot represents the given quantity 
(e.g. distance to an a-priori known minimizer) as a 
function of number of used iterations. The 
'convergence' module implements methods 
drawing convergence plots of one or more 
algorithms into the same figure.

== 'pyotk.perfprof' module ==

The Dolan and More performance profiles are commonly 
used for comparing performance of different algorithms. 
For a given set of test problems and a given set of 
solvers, these performance profiles can be computed 
by using the 'perfprof' module.
